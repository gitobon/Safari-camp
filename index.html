        <h2><h2>Leleshwa Camp Accommodation  </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Nestled in a stream valley amongst picturesque hills and rolling plains, Leleshwa Camp consists of six well-appointed tents each of which have an en-suite bathroom and a large verandah. Each tent has either two single or one king sized bed with duvet bedding. The tents are insect-proof and pleasantly furnished with thoughtful touches. Bathrooms are fitted with flushing toilets and a hot safari shower. At night, hurricane lamps bathe the camp in a soft, warm light and Masai warriors are on patrol to escort you.        
          <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Encountering massive herds of zebra and wildebeest (in the migration season), ungulates and powerful big cats in the conservancy and greater Masai Mara. Feeling the rush of excitement that always accompanies a walking safari. You're likely to have some intimate encounters, so it's comforting to know that you're in the safe hands of a guide and armed Masai guard. This real treat comes with an additional charge, but a balloon ride is worth every cent. Nothing compares to the thrill of floating silently through the dawn sky and seeing the East African plains below. The trip culminates in a champagne bush breakfast in the Mara.

            <p style="text-align:justify; font: weight 6px;">
              In the Community Area guests are not bound by game reserve rules and in addition to their day game drives can enjoy sundowners followed by night game drives, guided bush walks and Masai community activities, including visiting a traditional village and local school.
              </p>
              <h2>The property</h2>
                <p> 
                  The dining and lounge tents are open to catch the breezes and the views. After your game drive, relax in a comfortable chair with a book, play a board game from the library or have a drink at the bar. As darkness falls, hurricane lanterns are lit and a fire set in the firepit. Dinner is served in the long-tabled dining room, and the food is consistently good. The camp makes you reach for superlatives – you're treated like royalty! There are just seven tents (five standard and two suites). The tents are of similar size, decorated in natural colours highlighted with splashes of colour. Each is spacious, with an extra-large king-sized bed (wonderfully fine linen) and a sitting area opening on to a private veranda with wide views of the Loita Hills. The en-suite bathrooms have porcelain basins, running water, showers and flush toilets. The suites have an adjoining lounge, ideal for families. All accommodation has battery-powered electricity.

          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            This is not camping, it's glamping. Awesome tents, including personal bathrooms, and the best safari vehicles we've seen. A hint: If you're planning an after-dinner night drive in search of leopards on the hunt and other nocturnal species, dress warmly. Take a game drive (day drives include delicious breakfasts and lunches – no ham and cheese sandwiches here!), see the nocturnal wildlife or go on a foot safari. Fancy exploring the Loita Hills? Take a multi-day hike with a local Maasai guide. Visit a local village, learn skills like wildlife tracking or spear-throwing. The conservancy secures the area around the camp for future generations of Masai people, and a contribution to the conservancy is made on behalf of each guest.        </p>

        <h2>Leleshwa Camp Experience   </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
<b>Leleshwa camp</b>  one of the <b>smallest camps in Masai Mara</b>  eco-system, is located on the wooded banks of the ...... little <b>Ropile River</b>  in the Siana Conservancy, northeast of the Maasai Mara National Reserve, this is a relatively remote area of mixed herding and wildlife, which has dense concentrations of plains game including elephant and giraffe, there are virtually no other <b>tented camps in Siana Conservancy</b>  the area. Since 2016, <b>Leleshwa camp</b>  is a very small and personably hosted, and oozing with bush atmosphere, this is a tented camp for safari-lovers who really want to get away from it all. The guiding is top-rate and the camp has a good relationship with the local community. Very comfortable tents and particularly good food make staying a pleasure. With thousands of acres to explore, shared only with other Leleshwa guests, this is a very likeable and highly recommended <b>safari camp. Leleshwa camp</b>  also introduced <b>Leleshwa mobile Camp</b>  and has only been bookable on an exclusive use basis and can be set up in many parts of Kenya. Please talk to us if you would like to find out more. You know that a stay at <b>Leleshwa camp</b>  is going to be a bit special from the moment you get out of the 4x4 that has brought you along bush roads from Siana airstrip. From the small parking area, a wooden footbridge leads to the mess and dining tent and lawns above the steep banks of the river. Narrow sandy paths, winding through dense bush, lead from the central area to the guest tents. <b>Leleshwa camp</b>  (named after the wild camphor bush that is often used as an air freshener and sanitiser in Maasai homes), is prone to being visited by wildlife, as the grisly leopard ‘larder’ (the dried remains of an impala hanging in a tree in camp). Escorts are essential after dark to accompany guests to dinner and back again. The camp has <b>seven tents</b>, four of which are standard – two twins, two doubles – with the doubles having super-king-size beds of 2.1m x 2.1m (7ft x 7ft) and the single beds being 2.1m x 1.05m (7ft x 3ft 6in). The two suites are usually taken by families: each includes a double bed and two-day beds, which are most suitable for children. Extra beds are available, making triples possible in standard tents, though that is a bit tight. The tents are large without being self-consciously massive, and that style – doing things very well and properly, but not trying to create false impressions – extends to the sensibly tiled bathrooms, understated washstands and shower areas with designer toiletries and nicely bottled filtered water rather than throwaway plastic bottles. The tents have outside veranda or lounging areas, some overlooking the stream valley and each tent is nicely separated by dense bush from the others, making them all quite private. Each tent has a tea and coffee chest (staff bring hot water at your wake-up call), which also includes a torch and alarm horn. The manager will ask you what <b>activities</b>  you want to do. Day one of most guests’ stays is typically a full day in the reserve. The opportunities for walks and drives in the <b>Siana Conservancy</b>  are limitless and you’re sharing tens of thousands of acres largely with other Leleshwa guests only. The guiding is top-rate and the Siana area has plenty of plains game, but guests normally visit the reserve for better chances of seeing big cats. We saw large numbers of elephants and giraffe, jackals with a Thomson’s gazelle fawn kill, some particularly grumpy buffalo and a pair of secretary birds on their nest, as well as dozens of other species. Morning and evening drives are also popular at <b>Leleshwa camp</b>, as are <b>bush walking safaris, </b>  which can be long or short and may include a vehicle component or be purely on foot <b>safari</b>  depending on your energy level. Leleshwa (named after the wild camphor bush that is often used as an air freshener and sanitiser in Maasai homes), has good <b>cultural contacts</b>  with the local Siana community and guests can participate in a range of cultural activities. In the early morning, guests are often driven into the local village and may walk out to the grazing areas with the herders and their livestock. School visits are often done later in the morning, following an early game drive or game walk and a bush breakfast. Market days are Tuesday and Thursday. In the late afternoon guests may walk in with the cattle; when there are calves in the herds there’s often a lot of colourful activity. With advance notice, Maasai blessing ceremonies for couples can be arranged, running from late afternoon to midnight and involving up to two or three dozen local Maasai participants. The price, which includes the specially made Maasai ‘wedding attire’ to keep, varies from US$600 to US$900 per couple. 
For more adventurous guests, there’s the option of a one-night <b>fly camp</b>  near the main camp, and a (minimum two-night) <b>mobile camp</b>  on a Talek special campsite or in the Loita Hills east of Leleshwa. These activities need advance notice.

        <h2>Siana Conservancy </h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
The 29,000-acre <b>Siana Conservancy</b>  was established in 2010 when land was set aside <b>by Siana Group Ranch</b>  and the priority for the conservancy is wildlife protection, scouts and rangers regularly monitor the area. <b>Siana Conservancy</b>  represents another ecologically-valuable buffer zone that extends the protection and conservation efforts of the eastern zone of Masai Mara. Like other privately owned property surrounding the <b>Masai Mara National Park</b>, the lands and the wildlife on the Siana Group Ranch were not thriving… nor were its inhabitants, the Maasai people. Overgrazing and other poor land-use contributed to its decline. But inspired by the success of Kenya’s growing conservancy movement in 2010, the 1,200 landowners joined forces with six Siana safari camps to create the new conservancy. This was not only a big win for <b>Mara Siana Conservancy</b>  but Kenya’s wildlife as well. More than 70 percent of the country’s animals live outside the protected national park system, The <b>Siana conservancy</b>  movement increasingly shelters these numbers as well. The 35,000-acre conservancy offers its restricted number of guests the opportunity to <b>Masai Mara safari</b>  without the crowds often seen in the adjoining national park. But like in the <b>Masai Mara Reserve</b>, tourists will be treated to lots of big cats, plenty of elephants and giraffes, and smaller species like gazelles, Topis, elands, hartebeests, and dik-diks. There are lots of great reasons conservancies are springing up throughout Kenya: natural restoration of the land, increasingly rich wildlife, an unrivaled safari experience, and life-changing benefits for the local people such as the Maasai. <b>Mara Siana</b>  is just the latest conservancy experiment to enjoy success as a promising destination for tourism in the rich Mara eco-system. The lands of the conservancy are an abundant buffer zone, alive with animals in this active wildlife region. Visitors will find a wonderful array of grazers here – buffaloes, giraffes, gazelles, zebras, topis, dik-diks, elands, and so many others. And in the grand scheme of nature, right behind those grazers look for several resident prides of <b>lions, </b>  plus <b>leopards, cheetahs, </b>  African wild dogs, and hyenas. The conservancy is a migration corridor for <b>elephant herds, </b>  and some are truly impressive with over 200 individuals in a family. Wildebeests also hold a special place in Siana’s eco-system. During the <b>Great Migration</b>  from July through October, great masses of these creatures pass through the conservancy, creating an unrivaled spectacle of herding wildlife. However, prior to the migration during January and February, visitors can also witness the unique wonder of innumerable <b>wildebeests calving</b>  in the Loita Hills area. One of the benefits of <b>Siana conservancy in Masai Mara</b>  – in direct contrast to the great numbers of wildlife – are the few tourists found here, the game viewing is unhurried and uncrowded, for that is how the conservancy model is designed. There are just six <b>safari camps in Siana</b>  conservancy for an expansive ratio of 1 room per 250 acres. And in keeping with the conservancy style, visitors can enjoy activities not found in the national parks: <b>walking safaris</b>  with a Maasai guide, <b>fly camping in the bush, </b>  and <b>night game drive safaris</b>. A nocturnal outing may include sightings of mongoose, fox, bush babies, and sometimes porcupine and aardvark. The cultural experiences here are authentic, unlike some of the heavily touristed village visits found elsewhere. Guests may get lessons in beadwork, traditional medicine, and even such unexpected activities as handling a <b>Maasai spear</b>. One can also arrange visits to a local elementary school and nearby markets. Wildebeests are considered both resident and migratory in the <b>Siana conservancy Masai Mara. </b>   The resident wildebeests are found in the <b>Loita Hills</b>, and our guests who stay in the conservancy during January and February may witness the birth of new calves. The land that has been set aside for Siana Conservancy also serve as part of the path used by hordes of <b>wildebeests and zebras as part of the Great Migration from July to October</b>. The <b>Siana conservancy</b>  also hosts several research projects. Mara Predator Hub monitors and studies lions, African wild dogs and cheetahs, and Elephant Voices tracks pachyderm movements in the conservancy. The accommodations that are part of Siana are Leleshwa Camp, Mara Bushtops and Siana Springs Camp; though, more Siana Lodge are expected to join in as the <b>Siana conservancy</b>  matures. Its mission is to have a maximum of 10 member accommodations that will house a ceiling of 230 beds – around 115 double rooms (1 room per over 250 acres). A migration corridor for elephants cuts right through the Siana conservancy. Some of the herds are massive with over 200 members to a family. <b>Fly Camping </b> – for a truly authentic moment, try camping in the bush with your Maasai guide. Under his expert tutelage, you can track elephants and relax at your campsite, cooking dinner over an open fire. Then retire to your tent, as nature’s night sounds lull you to sleep.

For the ultimate <b>Masai Mara Honeymoon holiday</b>  prioritize exclusivity and intimacy when choosing your camp or lodge. Rather than staying at one of the massive lodges in the eastern section of the park – some of which have 150 beds – pick a small camp that has less than 10 tented rooms on your <b>Honeymoon holidays</b>. A great option for romantic couples who want to escape the crowds of the Masai Mara is staying in one of the many private conservancies that border the reserve, which offer the same superb wildlife viewing and photogenic landscapes, but with a restricted number of beds per acre and a limited number of vehicles per sighting, which makes for a much more exclusive wilderness experience on your Kenya Honeymoon experience. Mobile tented camps are also a wonderful option for a <b>Honeymoon in Masai Mara</b>, as they are usually very small, with only a few beds, and give you the chance to experience life under canvas in remote locations – but with the creature comforts of hot bucket showers, flush toilets, five-star quality food and stylish furnishings.
